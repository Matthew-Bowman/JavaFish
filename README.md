# JavaFish

## Description

JavaFish was a project built on-top of a problem statement where a design was developed based on object orientated principles. An understanding of SOLID was used to aid in the development of the following designs utilised in the construction of the software artefact. The application was initialised with IntelliJ IDEA and developed using this IDE. JavaFish was also built depending on a Simulation Framework which is named JFF2 and can be found [here](src/libraries/).
